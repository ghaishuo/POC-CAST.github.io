**Computer Vision Guided Bolt Tightening Robot for Power Transmission Tower**<br/>
Undergraduate Capstone Project<br/>
Sept 2021 – Dec 2021<br/>
Instructor: Professor Youyi Bi, Sponsor: State Grid Corporation of China

- Led a team of 5 members to design, manufacture, and verify a prototype of a bolt tightening robot that could climb up vertically along a power transmission tower, which won the gold design prize.
- Implemented computer vision to guide the end effector to screw bolt sequences on vertical plane.
- Applied bionic leg from silkworm and magnetic force for climbing and adhesion, which could support the weight of 40kg during climbing and screw bolts with torque higher than 50 N·m.
